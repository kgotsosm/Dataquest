# Dataquest Data Engineering Learning Path
**This repository contains the notebooks I created as part of the Dataquest learning path for data engineering. The learning path covers a wide range of topics related to data engineering and provides hands-on experience using tools and technologies commonly used in the field.**

## Learning Path
The Dataquest data engineering learning path includes the following modules:

- Introduction to Python for Data Engineering
- Working with Data Sources
- Processing Large Datasets in Pandas
- SQL Fundamentals
- Building a Data Pipeline
- Production Databases in Python
- Data Pipeline Orchestration with Airflow
Each module contains a series of interactive lessons and exercises designed to help learners develop practical skills in data engineering.

## Usage
Feel free to explore the notebooks in this repository to see how I worked through the exercises and applied the concepts covered in the learning path. You can run the notebooks yourself by cloning this repository and running them in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

## Contributing
I am not currently accepting contributions to this repository, as it is intended to showcase my personal work on the Dataquest data engineering learning path. However, feel free to fork the repository and create your own version if you would like to contribute your own work.
